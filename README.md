## The project is abandoned

It uses the old VK API, which doesn't work since 2017. Later, in 2019, the
messages API was restricted (due to privacy reasons):
https://vk.com/dev/messages_api

The author lost his interest in performing backups of his VK chats. The script
will not be fixed.

Please, file an issue or send a pull request if you know a maintained tools for
fetching chats from VK -- I'll add links here.

## About

The script for locally saving and incremental updating private and groupchat messages from social service vk.com.

## Requirements

* python 3
* requests

## How to use

Configure and first run:

* Open [this link](https://oauth.vk.com/authorize?client_id=5048703&redirect_uri=https://oauth.vk.com/blank.html&display=page&scope=offline,messages&response_type=token&v=5.37) in a browser and confirm permissions for the 'messages backup' application, in fact that is just obtaining an access token with certain rights.
* Copy `access_token` and `user_id` values from URL in an address bar and put it to the `config.json` file, use `config.json.example` as the format reference.
* Run `./vk_messages_backup.py`.

The script will generate `storage` directory with json dump of gotten data and `chatlogs` directory with formatted chat logs (both in a current working directory).

Incremental update:

* Rerun `./vk_messages_backup.py` in the same directory as before.

## Details

The script used straightforward approaches and algorithms, so don't wonder if it consume lots or memory and CPU time for processing and formatting the messagesâ€™ dump. The processing of some corner cases are not implemented properly.
